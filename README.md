# HeartPulse AI: Heart Disease Prediction & XAI System

HeartPulse AI is a modern, responsive web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using Machine Learning and interprets those predictions using **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques. 

Built on a **Flask** backend with a premium, futuristic glassmorphic radium-cyan user interface, the system leverages **SHAP** and **LIME** to explain *why* the model made a specific classification—providing transparent, feature-level insights into patient risk factors.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Predictive Power:** Employs a pre-trained machine learning classifier to estimate heart disease risk.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):**
  * **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):** Explains individual predictions by identifying local feature contributions.
  * **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** Calculates Shapley values to measure the global and local impact of each clinical attribute.
* **Neural Insights:** Highlights the top risk factors and healthy indicators for each prediction.
* **Radium Dark-Mode UI:** A high-end, responsive, glassmorphic dashboard styled with modern typography and sleek cybernetic accents.
* **Cloud Ready:** Fully configured with `Procfile` and `runtime.txt` for deployment on Render or Railway.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.12+ (Recommended)
* Git

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd heart-diseases-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   * **Windows (PowerShell):**
     ```powershell
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
   * **macOS / Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ⚡ Deployment Guide

This project is pre-configured with **Gunicorn** (`--timeout 120 --workers 1`) and standard deployment configurations. The `PORT` environment variable is automatically read from the host platform.

### Deploy to Render
1. Create a new **Web Service** on Render connected to your Git repository.
2. Select **Python** as the runtime environment.
3. Configure the commands:
   * **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   * **Start Command:** Auto-detected from `Procfile` (`gunicorn app:app --timeout 120 --workers 1`)
4. Click **Deploy Web Service** — no additional environment variables required.

### Deploy to Railway
1. Start a new project on Railway and choose **Deploy from GitHub**.
2. Select this repository.
3. Railway will auto-detect the `runtime.txt` and `Procfile` and deploy your app instantly.
